## Summary

I am an open, cheerful, and purposeful person. After five successful years of working in sales and marketing in the FMSG market decided that I no longer want to generate ideas to sell something but want to use my mind to create interesting, useful, and meaningful things. And what but programming can give a person complete freedom to create in the era of digitalization.

I chose programming for the iOS system as the main direction for development. Why?  I like Apple products like a billion other people on the planet, and I have some fun ideas for creating my apps. That's why I decided to combine business with pleasure.

My main goal is to prove to myself that a radical change in the type of activity is possible at any time, as long as you like what you do. I get into programming almost from scratch, so I'm more interested than ever in testing all my abilities, especially learning on the fly skill.
